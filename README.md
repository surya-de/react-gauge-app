# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

## Install the packages
There could be a React version mismatch that might not allow installation. Use `--force` to bypass that issue. 
```
npm install --force
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
